# CenCalVia

CenCalVia Open Streets will bring the open streets movement to The Central Valley. It will stimulate the local economy, change the narrative of Fresno, and engage the community in a wide variety of healthy physical activities.

Over 50  cities in the US already temporarily turn commercial streets into “paved parks”.   Residents are invited to bike, walk, skate, take classes in yoga, zumba, hula hooping, bicycle safety and repair, or martial arts along the streets and sidewalks without car traffic.  Area businesses benefit by selling  food and non-alcoholic drinks, drawing increased foot traffic and by generating significant community goodwill with their participation.  Some other ways businesses can participate might be to create activity stations, sponsor a band or donate to the many expenses involved in managing an event that will attract at least 1000 participants.  

Sponsoring an open streets project is a great way to help create a healthy and  vibrant community and to spur economic activity.  A 2010 study found that 40.4% of Fresno’s children are overweight or obese. The City of Fresno has been dead last of the largest US cities with respect to park acreage. The availability of safe, open spaces for people is critical to our public health and special events encourage increased spending  and return business.
